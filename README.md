🎵 Spotify Clone

As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls -play, pause, and next.I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub.

 It features a clean UI and essential music player functions like:

🔊 Play / Pause / Next / Previous controls

🎶 Displays song name and cover

🎚️ Interactive progress bar

📱 Responsive layout for different screens
